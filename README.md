## Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data from 2021 and 2022 to uncover trends related to accident severity, vehicle types involved, road surface conditions, lighting conditions, and accident locations. 

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to analyze road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022 and answer key performance indicators (KPIs) related to accident trends. The analysis focuses on:

## Primary KPIs
- Total number of casualties resulting from accidents.
- Breakdown of casualties by accident severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight) along with their percentage of the total.
- Identification of the vehicle type involved in the highest number of casualties.

## Secondary KPIs
- Total casualties categorized by vehicle type.

## Trend Analysis and Distribution
- Monthly comparison of casualties between the current year and the previous year.
- Maximum casualties by road type.
- Distribution of casualties based on road surface conditions.
- Relationship between casualties by location/area (Urban vs Rural) and lighting conditions (Day vs Night).
- Trendline analysis comparing casualties in 2021 and 2022.

## Data Source
**File:** [Road Accident Data.xlsx]([path_to_file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R_uaoZL18nRbqC_MULVne90h3SdRbAyn/edit?gid=1319047066#gid=1319047066))  
The dataset includes records of road accidents across multiple factors such as severity, location, road type, lighting, and vehicle types.

## Tools and Methodology
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed null, duplicate, and irrelevant entries.
- **Data Processing:** Organized data based on year, vehicle type, road conditions, and light conditions.
- **Data Analysis:** Calculated KPIs and identified trends and high-risk factors.
- **Data Visualization:** Built an interactive dashboard to present key findings.

## Dashboard Highlights
- Accident severity breakdown (Fatal, Serious, Slight)
- Casualties by vehicle type
- Casualties by month (2021 vs 2022)
- Road type and surface condition analysis
- Lighting and urban vs rural accident trends

## Key Insights

### Primary KPIs

| Accident Severity | Number of Casualties | % of Total |
|-------------------|----------------------|------------|
| Fatal             | 7,135                | 1.71%      |
| Serious           | 59,312               | 14.19%     |
| Slight            | 351,436              | 84.10%     |
| **Total**         | **417,883**          | **100%**   |

- **Insight:** The majority of accidents resulted in slight injuries (84.1%), with fatal cases accounting for just 1.7%.

### Casualties by Vehicle Type

Top 3:
- **Cars:** 333,485 casualties
- **Bikes:** 33,672 casualties
- **Vans:** 33,472 casualties

- **Insight:** Cars were involved in nearly 80% of accidents leading to casualties.

### Monthly Trends (2021 vs 2022)
- Overall decline in casualties in 2022 compared to 2021.
- The most significant drops happened in January and December.

### Road Type
- **74%** of casualties happened on single carriageways.

### Road Surface Conditions
- Most accidents happened on **dry roads**, highlighting that favorable weather doesn’t guarantee safety.

### Lighting and Location
- More accidents occurred during **daylight** and in **urban areas**.

## Recommendations
- Strengthen safety campaigns targeted at **car drivers** and **urban areas**.
- Improve **infrastructure** and **signage** on single carriageways.
- Investigate behavioral factors causing high daytime accidents.
- Time interventions around **peak accident months**.

## Conclusion
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of road accident patterns from 2021 to 2022.  
The findings emphasize the need for focused efforts in **driver education**, **road design improvements**, and further research to make roads safer for everyone.
